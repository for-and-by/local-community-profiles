This is an app designed to better facilitate community reporting of flooding incidents around the Brisbane area.

Users are encouraged to provide images, descriptions and severity of incidents, to help inform people who are out of the area as to what is going on.

When an event has been made, it'll stick around for 18 hours before it disappears, unless somebody comes along and verifies the event is still ongoing,

This app was created by Jordan Accinelli, and uses MapBox, Google Analytics, Next.js, Vercel and MongoDB for event storage.
