# Changelog

Here's a list of the things we've changed, added or removed since we started working on Floodwatch

### First round of refinements
Date:  02/03/2022

#### Fixes & Updates

- Changed nav to be vertical instead of horizontal.
- Resolved issue with nav showing up over pop ups, modals and drawers.
- Updated events query to be handled client side

#### Additions

- Wrapped application in Redux to preserve event state, and allow application to only get most recent events since last
  load.
