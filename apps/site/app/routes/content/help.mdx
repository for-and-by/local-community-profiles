### Looking at Events

If you're looking to see what other people have
submitted, drag around the map and click on the icons
scattered across the map. This will let you know more
about what you're looking at, and clicking 'More
Details' will show you all the data provided by the
user who submitted the event.

### Reporting New Events

If you're looking to submit your own event, click on
the map the nearest you can to the location that the
event is happening. Then, click 'Report Event
Here.' You'll be prompted to provide an image of
the issue, a brief description and a severity rating.
