# About Safer Streets

The Safer Streets app is designed to support community reporting of local hazards and safety issues.

### How does it work?

Users are encouraged to provide details around local hazards and safety issues. User submitted data is displayed on a map, and will expire depending on certain conditions (depending on the type of information provided).

The data is not intentionally anonymized, but does not require submission to be tied to a user account or profile.

### Content & Moderation

This content is not moderated in any way and is managed using good faith. Please don't abuse this platform, it's here to try and make everyone's lives easier.

### Built on Open Source

This app was created by "For & By", a tech community initiative run by Jordan Accinelli, and uses open source libraries to achieve its goals. This project would not be possible without:

- MapLibre GL: For mapping utilities
- MapTiler: For Vector GL Map Tiles & Geocoding
- React: For rendering the UI
- Vite: For asset bundling
- Redux: For global state management
- Nucleo: As an icon library
- Firava: A variable font port of Fira Sans
